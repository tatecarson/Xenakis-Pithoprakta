# Stochastic Music 

---

> "European music is ill-suited to providing the world with a field of expression on a planetary scale, as a universality, and risks isolating and severing itself from historical necessities... 

---

> ...We must open our eyes and to other cultures, as well as towards the immediate future of musical thought,before we perish suffocating from electronic technology, either at the instrumental level or at the level of composition by computers (Xenakis, 13)."

## 1950s musical problems

- Scientific music based on information theory or cybernetics
- Chance music based on graphic notation or fluxus happenings

note:
He sees two different musical axis of the 1950s in opposition, purely scientific music derived from information theory and cybernetics (serialism), and that of intuition using graphic scores and fluxus happenings to bring in chance. 

He doesn't think either of these have much of a place in music alone. He falls somewhere in between with a mix of scientific and intuitive thought.

# Axiomatic music 
## Stochastics

note:
He wishes to create an axiomatic system which looks back to the ancient past but includes the present and the future. It also should incorporate musics of the world, from Asia and Africa. 

This system building is reminiscent of serialism, where Schoenberg put himself in the lineage of the German masters. Xenakis is more bold. He saw serialism as the end of something rather than the beginning.

> In its place I proposed a world of sound-masses, vast groups of sound-events, clouds and galaxies governed by new characteristics such as density, degree of order, and rate of change, which require definitions and calculations using probability (Xenakis, 3)

note:
He sees the roots of stochastic thought to have pre-Christian origins Ancient Greece, Byzantium, plainchant. Primarily because it wasn’t ET and they dealt with time in a less linear way. 

While he sees certain musical complexities as having died in the west they lived on in eastern musics.

## Orchestration

- 2 Trombones, xylophone, woodblock
- 12 violins, 12 second violins,  8 Altos, 8 violincellos, 6 Contre basses

note:
a traditional orchestration for a very non-traditional sound

### Graphic method of composition

> "I had to organise this new material. It was natural for me and my advantage over other composers was that I could design. It was much easier for me to use a graphic approach to music than the classical notation with which I had never been able to see everything at the same time, as you do on a graph... 

---

> ...To organize the material I had to use Probability Theory, a fantastic and general way to approach the problem (Matossian, 92)."

note:
Each instrument in each section is playing something different than their neighbor creating a great deal of complexity with relatively simple means. They not only are playing different notes and rhythms but switch playing techniques every three measures as shown below:
